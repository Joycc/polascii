POLASCII - an ASCII version of Polaroid-like camera
========

This is a small project intended for public demonstration. It runs on Raspberry Pi with Picamera and AALib(ASCII Art). It lively refreshes with the camera video, and will print out an ASCII-Art photo when user push a button.

This project is a work of community contribution. Thanks to the happy guys below:

DD@SZDIY	- for the Raspberry Pi and the camera
Danfei@SZDIY	- for the thermal printer
Laowang@SZDIY	- for the case

The software is still *under development*. Stay tuned.
